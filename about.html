      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>
        Delivering the most complete gaming experience on mobile. That’s the
        goal we had in mind when we set up REDMAGIC. Establishing ourselves in
        October 2017 as the gaming arm of Nubia, we’ve sought to harness their
        skill in smartphone design and combine it with a gamer’s determination
        in achieving high performance gameplay. The result? Imagine devices that
        strike the balance between sleek, ergonomic hardware and fully optimised
        software. Gaming smartphones that are powerful and durable, but cool to
        the touch. But we’re just getting started. And with these resources at
        our disposal, we’ve made it our mission to break further ground and
        unlock the potential of mobile gaming.
